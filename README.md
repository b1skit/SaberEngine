# Saber Engine

"Ideally, a Jedi took many months to construct a single perfect weapon that he or she would keep and use for a lifetime. Once you build it, the lightsaber will become your constant companion, your tool, and a ready means of defense." - Luke Skywalker

-----------------
Project Overview:
-----------------
Saber Engine is a multi-API, multi-threaded, real-time rendering R&D framework, with the architecture of a game engine.


--------
Details:
--------
- Currently supported graphics APIs:
	- OpenGL 4.6
	- DirectX 12
- Renders GLTF 2.0 scenes/assets
- Implemented with C++ 20


-----------------------
Command line arguments:
-----------------------
Scene loading: -scene Folder\Name\filename.extension  
	- Path is relative to the "<project root>\Scenes\" directory  
	- Supports GLTF 2.0 files

Display log messages in a system console window: -console  

Disable strict shader binding checks: -relaxedshaderbinding  
	- Skip (helpful, but occasionally annoying) asserts if textures/parameters aren't found in a shader

Enable graphics API debugging: -debuglevel [0, 2]  
	- 0: Default (disabled)  
	- 1: Basic debug output (OpenGL, DX12)  
	- 2: Level 1 + GPU-based validation (DX12 only)  
	- 3: Level 2 + DRED breadcrumbs (DX12 only)  

----------------------
Runtime Configuration:
----------------------
Settings are loaded from the "<project root>\config\config.cfg" file  
	- Commands for system configuration ("set"), input ("bind"), etc  
	- See the existing file for examples  
Default controls:  
	- Movement: WASD + mouse look  
	- Down: Shift  
	- Up: Space  
	- Toggle VSync: v  


------------
Conventions:
------------
- Right-handed coordinate system  
- UV (0,0) = Top-left  
- Depth near/far = [0,1]  


---------------------
Image-based Lighting:
---------------------
A per-scene IBL is loaded from ""<project root>\Scenes\SceneFolderName\IBL\ibl.hdr", if it exists  
	- A default IBL ("<project root>\Assets\DefaultIBL\ibl.hdr") is used as a fallback if no scene IBL is found  

--------
Shaders:
--------
For simplicity, naming patterns are used to associate Shaders.  
- OpenGL: Shaders sharing common names (with .vert/.geom/.frag suffixes) will be concatenated and compiled at runtime  
- DX12: Compiled Shader Objects (.cso) sharing a common name prefix are differentiated by a "<ShaderName>_<?>Shader.hlsl" suffix (e.g. Some_VShader.hlsl, Some_GShader.hlsl, Some_PShader.hlsl), and associated at runtime
